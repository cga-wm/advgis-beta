## Special Works Project 4
Hot off the presses.
A client wants a raster dataset that comprises of only categorical data that falls within specified regions of interest.

- The original raster data can be found in GeoTIFF format on the web.
    A list of all the URLs are provided in the text file (`hansen.txt`).
- The polygon regions of interest from which we are to extract the raster data are provided in a shapefile (`aze_all_buffer.zip`).

Your challenge, should you choose to accept it, is to create a single raster file made up of only the extracted regions of interest of all the individual raster files.
